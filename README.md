# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Note:VVVI : We should keep our static files always in public folder .
=>  Becouse when not proper imports is done then it may come probelm in production.  If we have  use any file of public folder(in root directory i.e public folder) then can access by "/filename"    . If some file are inside a folder in public folder then can access by "/foldername/filename"   . So it will be easy to  use it .
